# .erg wallet format

.erg wallets are a custom binary format used by Satergo to store the details of a wallet.

The byte order is big endian. The cipher used is AES/GCM/NoPadding with authentication tag length 128, see [AESEncryption.java](src/main/java/com/satergo/extra/AESEncryption.java).

## formatVersion 1
In this version there is a magic number to determine the filetype and the format version is not encrypted either.

The information is separated from the private key data to not need to keep both of them in-memory.

The two sections must be encrypted with the **same password** and must use **different nonce values**.

| Data type | Value                                                          |

| long      | format version                                                 |
| integer   | length of private key section (including 12 nonce bytes)       |
| byte[12]  | nonce/initialization vector (12 bytes)                         |
| data      | encrypted wallet private key data                              |
| integer   | length of encrypted details section (including 12 nonce bytes) |
| byte[12]  | nonce/initialization vector (12 bytes)                         |
| data      | encrypted details                                              |

Encrypted wallet private key data: `(short) wallet key type id` followed by the serialized data.
